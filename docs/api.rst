Event Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This page outlines the different types of events listened to by :meth:`Client.event`.
All events are 'sandboxed', in that if an exception is thrown while the event is called then it is caught and then ignored.


.. function:: on_ready()

    Called when the client is done preparing the data received from Discord. Usually after login is successful
    and the :attr:`Client.servers` and co. are filled up.

.. function:: on_disconnect()

    Called when the client disconnects for whatever reason. Be it error or manually.

.. function:: on_message(message)

    Called when a message is created and sent to a server.

    :param message: A :class:`Message` of the current message.

.. function:: on_response(response)

    Called whenever a message is received from the websocket. Used mainly for debugging purposes.
    The parameter passed is raw data that was parsed via ``json.loads``. Note that this is called
    before the :class:`Client` processes the event.

    :param response: The received message response after gone through ``json.loads``.

.. function:: on_message_delete(message)
              on_message_edit(before, after)

    Called when a message is deleted or edited from any given server. If the message is not found in the
    :attr:`Client.messages` cache, then these events will not be called. This happens if the message
    is too old or the client is participating in high traffic servers. To fix this, increase
    the ``max_length`` option of :class:`Client`.

    :param message: A :class:`Message` of the deleted message.
    :param before: A :class:`Message` of the previous version of the message.
    :param after: A :class:`Message` of the current version of the message.

.. function:: on_status(member):

    Called whenever a :class:`Member` changes their status or game playing status.

    :param server: The :class:`Member` who has had their status changed.

.. function:: on_channel_delete(channel)
              on_channel_create(channel)

    Called whenever a channel is removed or added from a server.

    Note that you can get the server from :attr:`Channel.server`.
    :func:`on_channel_create` could also pass in a :class:`PrivateChannel` depending
    on the value of :attr:`Channel.is_private`.

    :param channel: The :class:`Channel` that got added or deleted.

.. function:: on_member_join(member)
              on_member_remove(member)

    Called when a :class:`Member` leaves or joins a :class:`Server`.

    :param member: The :class:`Member` that joined or left.
